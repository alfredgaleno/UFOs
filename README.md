# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to provide a clean webpage that could be filtered to view different UFO sighting events. We used raw UFO sighting data nad utilized HTML, Java and various libraries to create a responsive webpage that allows the user to view sightings and sort by date, state, city, country, and shape.

## Results

This webpage can be used to help get specific details on sightings. A user can see if there are any similarities between sightings based on any of the filter inputs. They could explore whether similar sightings occured at the same time or in the same place. Below is a sample of the data when filtered for sightings in NY state.

THe site is a great source for infomation and can allow the user to discover insights for themselves.


## Summary

While the site is fairly comprehensive it mainly focuses on descriptive information. By only showing descriptions we are limited to some of the information we can gain from the data. Two additional recommendations would be to create a bar chart of sightings broken down by state to get a better analytical view, as well as further analytics on time periods to allow for better correleation between events. If users could see trends in location and time frames I think the site would be even more valuable.
